# Without Magic

A single repository of bash-first, minimal examples that teach how systems actually work.

Each sub-folder is a standalone topic with its own README.
You can clone this repo and run any topic independently without setting up the others.

## What “without magic” means

In this repo, “magic” is anything that:
- hides important behavior behind defaults
- works only if you already know how it works
- breaks outside the happy path
- prevents you from reasoning about failure

So the examples here prefer:
- explicit configuration
- minimal dependencies
- commands over screenshots
- clear failure modes

## How to use this repo

1. Pick a sub-folder under this main folder to learn
2. Read that topic’s README
3. Run the commands from inside that folder

> If this was useful, consider starring the repo so others can find it.
